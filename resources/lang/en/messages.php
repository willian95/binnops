    "digitalHubDescription2" => "Management of change is a very important aspect of any 3D virtual model because much of the model’s benefit results from model precision and its representation of the actual production assets and facilities. Therefore, the 3D virtual model software must be capable of accepting updates at any time via new laser scans, altered CAD information and direct model changes to reflect field conditions. Furthermore, changes must be automatically propagated (or inherited) to views, documents and integrated systems to ensure that all asset information and the 3D virtual model accurately reflect the plant.The Binnops Digital Hub permits that the Digital Intelligent Twin with detailed precision and dimensions be navigable by a common user and without the need of complex and

Bots are basically dedicated to learn, imitate and perform processes made by human beings based on certain rules",
    "rpaDescription2" => "When building Smart Digital Twins, thousands of engineering or process documents such as datasheets, plans, reports, among others can be processed, analyzed, and classified in matter of minutes through RPA. Also, when operating Smart Digital Twins (Just as it is made in the physical real Asset or process), Bots have the ability of performing Data gathering and interacting with any software or application in the way humans would, with the advantage of operating 24/7 and no fatigue pressure",
    "dataAnalyticsDescription1" => "Once Data is transferred to structured repositories in the cloud through defined gathering methods (by IoT, manual gathering or another integration of Databases), it is available to be analyzed at the level set by the defined Data governance and analytics level. Also, results can be visualized within our intuitive immediate and language-independent way over the Smart Digital Twin to accelerate conclusions on any analyzed system, process or asset and support the decision-making processes.

    "cibersecurityDescription" => "By creating virus attack and digital failure simulations, a digital twin can help the operator recognize potential cyber breaches and attacks and take the correct action to minimize the impact on the organization. The digital twin is vulnerable to attacks in the same way as the asset it mirrors and needs to be protected as well, whether by asynchronous connections, the use of AI as anomaly detectors, firewalls, or other means. In the digital twin journey, leaders must work on becoming learning leaders who creates environment of trust. Therefore, a more adversarial mindset is needed by engineers when developing systems. They must approach their own system like hackers, especially when protecting brownfield sites, thus, security becomes the cornerstone within the new operational business model to protect its three main components such as the data content, visualization and the model per se",
    "enginneringTitle" => "Engineering",
    "enginneringDescription1" => "The process industries have completely adopted 3D technology in computer-aided design (CAD) systems for initial plant design and engineering. However, the models and documentation created in these processes do not serve operating and maintenance tasks over the productive life of the assets. This is because the “as-designed” CAD representations often deviate from “as built” or field conditions and, over time, become less representative of the actual plant and equipment. (The 3D virtual models typically do not exist, and or are not updated as modifications are made to process equipment, nor is
    it cost-effective to maintain these CAD models.) ",
    "enginneringDescription2" => "Clients can walk the scanned images of the as-built model and identify discrepancies in existing process and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs). P&IDs can be corrected and made suitable for engineering work at a fraction of the labor otherwise required for field inspection, redlining and updating. Reducing staff exposure to the operating plant is an additional important safety benefit.",
    "enginneringDescription3" => "With accurate 3D virtual models, many engineering tasks can be transformed from a field exercise with paper and pencil to an office task where field conditions can be explored, accurate measurements taken and general productivity dramatically improved.",
    "revampsDescription" => "Plant turnarounds are distinct projects that often involve significant numbers of internal staff, contractors and suppliers. A typical turnaround consists of many work packages that have to be planned, coordinated and executed on a tight schedule.",
    "revampsDescription2" => "The 3D virtual model of the affected facilities provided tremendous value by enhancing communications and ensuring team familiarity with tasks and their environment. Timeconsuming walkthroughs are only taken as a final confirmation of the plans.",
    "maintencanceDescription1" => "Applications of the 3D virtual model for plant maintenance are many and varied, and the impact on best practices is significant. Maintenance personnel are able to quickly locate lines, equipment and instrumentation, and familiarize themselves with the location before going to the field to perform their work. Work orders are precisely linked to the target equipment or system and, through that connection, to the most current asset data. The model is a natural tool for organizing and visualizing maintenance history, operational data, test results and analysis.",
    "maintenanceDescription2" => "Sharing Databases with Enterprise Asset Managament or Asset Performance Management software is another
    breakthrough in the evolving Digital Twin industry as they are able to complement Data coming directly from
    field with historical information of all actions taken over the assets under the interactive and intuitive
    visual way of the 3D experience. The combination of multiple sources gives a new border for the governance
    of Data used to set Asset Management strategies throughout their lifecycle.",
    "reliabilityDescription" => "One of the most challenging constraints in the modern world of reliability are the accuracy of Data and governance of the every time more advanced language of dynamic equipment. Unleashing all the information from critical equipment introduces the engineers in a very complex world as Data is so abundant that giving governance is very difficult nowadays. Smart Digital Twins approach these challenges through the merge of technologies like IoT (Internet of Things) that allow Reliability analysts get not only accurate Data but also organized layers of information from equipment when consuming such Data under 3D environments, just by clicking on the asset of interest. Also, the interconnection of Digital Twins to analytics platforms with predictive and prescriptive levels may save a lot of time when configuration of results, beyond complex mathematical processes, show results under simple visual colored or simulated effects. This help engineers prioritize where resources really should be invested and avoid failures when systems are able to predict under complex systems above individual equipment.",
    "operationsDescription1" => "There are many opportunities to utilize the 3D virtual model in the operations department. For example, in the offsite area, determining the optimal routing for an ad hoc oil movement had relied on memory and potentially lengthy multiday site walks and investigation. With the 3D virtual model, routings are easily defined and, more importantly, the routings can often be optimally lined up and determined in just minutes.",
    "operationsDescription2" => "Operating procedures can be more easily created and reviewed because the model provides a true “in plant” perspective at the user’s desktop. Familiarizing personnel with facilities and procedures is greatly simplified. Procedures and training materials can be linked and accessed from within the 3D virtual model and an isolated view can be shown. Safety procedures, including isolation device locations, can be documented in full 3D and full context. HAZOP analysis can be performed with greater clarity and with accurate asset documentation. Location of persistent alarms can be visualized in their physical
    context. Creating work orders is a much more precise activity because the virtual model provides an easy way to tie the work order to the equipment piece of interest instead of at the process unit level. The virtual model also provides a 3D common basis for communication between operations and maintenance.",
    "integrityTitle" => "Integridad",
    "integrityDescription1" => "A common practice in process industries is to document inspection circuits using 2D isometric drawings with manual placement of the thickness monitoring locations (TMLs) and corrosion monitoring locations (CMLs) for stationary equipment. In parallel, an “inspection” database is kept with inspection dates, and other data for each circuit. The challenges in coordinating and maintaining accuracy under this system should be obvious. In contrast, inspection circuits documented in a 3D virtual model can be subset into individual views with TMLs and CMLs clearly called out in their exact geospatial location while linked dynamically to the source data.",
    "integrityDescription2" => " With such “active isometrics,” personnel can virtually walk the area before inspections, adding or subtracting detail to under- stand what they are dealing with. The model accuracy enables scaffolding design and other preliminary set-up work. And since the 3D virtual model always shows true placement and measurements, so do the isometric circuits. This avoids the possible and time-consuming inconvenience of inaccurate inspection circuit documentation. Plus, since the Smart Digital Twin allows the repository of results of inspections at every exact point which generates and accurate trend or avoid mistakes",
    "digitalDataDescription" => "The 3D Model of the Asset is built in a reverse way and based on cloud point data previously collected from the field. The models are produced using commercial software platforms such as SP3D, Cadworx, Autoplant, Revit, E3D etc. Upon population and building of completion of all the engineering databases , the geometrical or the intelligent model gets uploaded onto a web based platform for easy navigation and data management .",
